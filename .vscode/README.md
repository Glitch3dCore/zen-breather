# Zen Breather 🧘

**Code & Consciousness.**
A minimalist web app for relaxation and guided breathing, designed to bring a moment of mindfulness into the developer workflow.

##  About the Project
In the fast-paced world of software development, we often forget the most essential thing: breathing.
This project is an experiment at the intersection of **design, CSS animations, and JavaScript timing logic**.

It visually simulates a breathing rhythm (Inhale - Hold - Exhale) using a pulsating circle animation to guide the user through a calming session.

##  Tech Stack
* **HTML5** (Semantic structure)
* **CSS3** (Keyframe animations, Flexbox, Responsive Design)
* **JavaScript** (DOM manipulation, `setInterval` logic, State management)

##  Features
* **Start/Stop Functionality:** Interactive control over the session.
* **Synchronized Animation:** Text and shape act in perfect harmony.
* **Calming UI:** A color palette chosen to reduce eye strain and promote focus (matching the personal portfolio brand).
* **Privacy First:** Runs entirely locally in the browser with no tracking.
